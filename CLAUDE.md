## What is MDflow

A fast, lightweight markdown editor built with Tauri 2 + Rust. **Clean-room rewrite**
— independent, MIT-licensed. Same eventual feature set as the Kaelio editor, but
written from scratch with a modular architecture and refined UI. License: MIT.
Identifier: `com.kael.mdflow`. Current status: pre-code (spec done, M1 plan next).

**Always read `docs/spec.md` and `docs/tasks.md` before starting work.**

## Clean-room rule (do not violate — this is the legal basis of the project)

MDflow must stay legally independent of Kaelio / mx / Vibery Studio (those are
GPL-3.0). Therefore:

- **Never copy, paste, or port code or CSS from Kaelio.** Not a single line.
- Kaelio (`/Users/cong.bui/Kael/20-Projects/kaelio`) may be **read only as a behavior
  reference** — to learn *what* a feature does and *how it behaves* — then a fresh
  implementation is written from understanding, not from the source text.
- No names "mx", "Vibery", "Kaelio", or attribution to them anywhere in source, UI,
  or docs.
- This rule applies to every contributor, human or AI (including Codex).

### How to reference Kaelio correctly

When you want a feature to behave like Kaelio's: open the relevant Kaelio file by
absolute path, study the behavior, describe it in your own words / as a spec, then
implement fresh in MDflow. Do not keep Kaelio source open while typing MDflow code,
and never paste from it. Do not add Kaelio as a submodule or copy its files in.

## Working style (from global rules)

- Keep it simple. No premature abstraction. Small, focused files (one responsibility).
- Spec-driven: spec → plan → build → test → document, in order.
- Solo dev — favor low-risk, incremental, always-shippable steps.

## Commands

_TBD — added when the Tauri/Vite project is scaffolded (M1)._
